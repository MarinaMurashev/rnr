Getting stuff to work on Mac OS X (Lion)

To run the RnR on localhost:8080
	open Run -> Edit Configurations -> Server tab
		Plus sign (top left corner)
			select Tomcat server -> local

		Plus sign (bottom box)
			select Build Artifacts, select the exploded web app you created (only one option usually)

		Application Server: Tomcat 7.0 (copy/paste the CATALINA_BASE directory you get from typing catalina start in the terminal (remember to type catalina stop afterwards))

	Run -> Edit Configurations -> Deployment tab
Plus sign (for Deploy at the server startup box), select artifact, select the exploded web app artifact

Troubleshooting

If code shows errors due to missing libraries:
	import libraries: junit-4.1.0 and spring-framework-web if it's not there

If 'catalina start' in the terminal does not work:
	Install Tomcat 7.0.42
	have port 8080 open

If there is no artifact:
	Project Structure - Artifacts tab
	Plus sign, added Web App Exploded, selected main folder
	Make sure to add all the libraries to the artifact
