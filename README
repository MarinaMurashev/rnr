Getting stuff to work on Mac OS X (Lion)


************************************
BEFORE OPENING PROJECT IN INTELLIJ *
************************************


Run Maven compiler: compile in the directory where your pom xml file is located. (mvn compiler:compile)

To run the RnR on localhost:8080
	open Run -> Edit Configurations -> Server tab
		Plus sign (top left corner)
			select Tomcat server -> local

		Plus sign (bottom box)
			select Build Artifacts, select the exploded web app you created (only one option usually)

		Application Server: Tomcat 7.0 (copy/paste the CATALINA_BASE directory you get from typing catalina start in the terminal (remember to type catalina stop afterwards))

	Run -> Edit Configurations -> Deployment tab
Plus sign (for Deploy at the server startup box), select artifact, select the exploded web app artifact

~~~

Troubleshooting

If code shows errors due to missing libraries:
	import libraries: junit-4.1.0 and spring-framework-web if it's not there

If 'catalina start' in the terminal does not work:
	Install Tomcat 7.0.42
	have port 8080 open

If there is no artifact:
	Project Structure - Artifacts tab
	Plus sign, added Web App Exploded, selected main folder
	Make sure to add all the libraries to the artifact

If Intellij is throwing errors after these steps:
    Delete the project
    Check out from VCS on the home IntelliJ page using GIT
    Then open the project from the home IntelliJ page
    Repeat all above steps as necessary

If you seem to be missing an inordinate number of libraries and the artifact cannot be deployed
    Check your version of Java.
    Less than 1.7 will cause really funky errors

Linking your github account to the CI pipeline

Before committing go to snap-ci.com and click on get started.  Allow snap privileges to your github account.
Set up the rnr repo on snap. If the repo is not viewable on snap, talk to the github account manager, currently
Landon(lmedlock@thoughtworks.com). If you break the build FIX IT.
